# Alignment Tools

Tools and libraries for dealing with the [Scripture Burrito Alignment Format](https://github.com/bible-technology/alignment-spec).

Focus at the moment is on:
 - a test suite
 - a validator in Python
 - a parser in Python (that takes care of de-hoisting, etc)

## run Python tests

- `./tests.py`

## run Python tests with coverage

- `coverage run tests.py`
- `coverage html`
- open `htmlcov/index.html`
